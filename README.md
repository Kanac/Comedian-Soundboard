# Comedy-Soundboard
Comedy Soundboard for Universal Windows 8.1 (compatible with Windows 10)

A UI and UX centric app that will incorporate smooth UI and UX similiar to iDaft from Rudy Huyn.

This app is designed to compile a soundboard simply by the user first creating a comedian folder under Assets/Comedians/, then placing an image file here and all the required mp3 files in a sound folder. From there, my code will automatically parse the data and bind it to the XAML code, and magic happens from there. This allows for extreme ease in adding new content to the app (literally seconds of dragging and dropping files). Furthermore, I wrote code to humanize the title of each mp3 file to further save time from renaming the files to look nice. Combined with my content generation algorithms, the UI and UX is what really ties this app together. 

Currently developing a web crawler that will match funny audio according to a userâ€™s tastes to the seeded audio file as a way to try out Machine Learning.
